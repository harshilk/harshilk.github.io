Honestly, I don't really know what to write. Or how to write. 

I'll give this a shot though. Be warned -- there's like a 73% chance I'll quit blogging after 4 days. 

I guess I'll start with a little more about myself. My name is Harshil (like Herschel but spelled and pronounced in a different way (like Marshall with an H but not really)) and I'm going to be attempting the California section of the Pacific Crest Trail.

My official start date is 16th May. I can only be on the trail till ~24th July because of some prior commitments; but rest assured, I will be back some day to knock out Oregon and Washington. I'm about to graduate from the University of Illinois in less than a week. After, I'm moving to the east coast to pursue a PhD in stars and shit. And, yeah, I think that's about it? Oh -- I like sporks but I won't be taking one with me. I think we need a little healthy separation tbh. 

My gear list should be attached below. If I wasn't taking the camera, I would have a sub-10 lb base weight (base weight = weight of everything in the backpack minus food and water). But, alas, without Chikini Chameli (thx Priyanka), the trail will not be the same. And, yes, I'm including that Sriracha bottle in my base weight. It has become a part of who I am. 

I'll be sure to post a gear review after I'm done with the trail.
